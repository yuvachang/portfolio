Dear LendKey Hiring Manager,

I am a recent graduate from Fullstack Academy of Code with a former career in architecture and design.
I am very interested in your front-end role for the driven and transparent work environment and feel I would be able to fill the role quickly. 

I have experience in a handful of Javascript technologies in the Node.js environment across the stack and am a quick and eager learner on the job. A short sample of my (mostly React) work can be seen at https://yuvachang.com 

From my previous profession, I understand the importance of upholding responsibilities and meeting client deadlines throughout the different phases of design. In my last workplace I was able to develop and maintain a digital design approach in the office and produced many significant pieces of representational work. I believe my experience in a demanding/fast-paced environment and ability to learn new technologies quickly sets me ahead and will let me contribute fully to the engineering team. 

Please let me know if we can take next steps in the application. I would love to hear back from you.

Thanks for your time and consideration,

Yuva Chang
