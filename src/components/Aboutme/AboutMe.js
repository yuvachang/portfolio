        Hello!
        <br />
        <br />
        I am Yuva, a software engineer living in New York City.
        <br />
        <br />
        After my completing my masters at University of Michigan in 2015, I worked in design and
        architecture. I found myself working extensively with software and doing repetitive tasks
        that could be automated, and I often used scripts others had written. After a bit of
        research, I realized the potentional of coding and the excitement of writing your own
        working code.
        <br />
        <br />I decided to take the plunge and took a full-time coding bootcamp called Fullstack
        Academy. There's constantly new technology and new ways to solve a problem; there's always
        something new to learn.
